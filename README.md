EndNote-Helper
==============
A simple automation script to move references into groups within EndNote.


This script installs various hotkeys which assist with EndNote reference screening.

| `Number 3`    | "                              |
| `Num pad 0`   | Move reference to fourth group |
| `Num pad 4`   | "                              |
| `Number 4`    | "                              |
| `Pause`       | Exit EndNote-Helper            |


Installation
============
The simplest way to get EndNote-Helper running is to [download the compiled program](https://github.com/CREBP/EndNoteHelper/raw/master/EndNoteHelper.exe) and run it.

You will see this icon: ![EndNoteHelper tray icon](src/EndNoteHelper.png) in the system tray when the program is running.

Simply hit any of the above [keys](#keys) to run that function. The keys will **only** work when viewing an EndNote citation library (no other screen within EndNote). It is recommended that you create the groups before trying to move references to them.
